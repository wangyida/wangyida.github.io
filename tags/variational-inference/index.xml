&lt;p&gt;Deep learning approaches process data in a layer-by-layer way with intermediate (or latent) features. We aim at designing a general solution to optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification, segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models. This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called &lt;em&gt;nebula anchors&lt;/em&gt;, that guide the latent variables to form clusters during training. To prevent the anchors from clustering among themselves, we employ the variational constraint that enforces the latent features within an anchor to form a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a generative model we refer as Nebula Variational Coding (NVC). Since each latent feature can be labeled with the closest anchor, we also propose to apply metric learning in a self-supervised way to make the separation between clusters more explicit. As a consequence, the latent variables of our variational coder form clusters which adapt to the generated semantic of the training data, &lt;em&gt;e.g&lt;/em&gt;. the categorical labels of each sample. We demonstrate experimentally that it can be used within different architectures designed to solve different problems including text sequence, images, 3D point clouds and volumetric data, validating the advantage of our proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We propose an approach to estimate the 3D pose of a human hand while grasping objects from a single RGB image.  Our approach is based on a probabilistic model implemented with deep architectures, which is used for regressing, respectively, the 2D hand joints heat maps and the 3D hand joints coordinates.  We train our networks so to make our approach robust to large object- and self-occlusions, as commonly occurring with the task at hand. Using specialized latent variables, the deep architecture internally infers the category of the grasped object so to enhance the 3D reconstruction, based on the underlying assumption that objects of a similar category, i.e. with similar shape and size, are grasped in a similar way. Moreover, given the scarcity of 3D hand-object manipulation benchmarks with joint annotations, we propose a new annotated synthetic dataset with realistic images, hand masks, joint masks and 3D joints coordinates. Our approach is flexible as it does not require depth information, sensor calibration, data gloves, or finger markers.  We quantitatively evaluate it on synthetic datasets achieving stateof-the-art accuracy, as well as qualitatively on real sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Generative Model with Coordinate Metric Learning for Object Recognition Based on 3D Models</title>

&lt;p&gt;Collecting data for deep learning is so tedious which makes it hard to establish a perfect database. In this paper, we propose a generative model trained with synthetic images rendered from 3D models which can reduce the burden on collecting real training data and make the background conditions more sundry. Our architecture is composed of two subnetworks: semantic foreground object reconstruction network based on Bayesian inference and classification network based on multi-triplet cost training for avoiding over-fitting on monotone synthetic object surface and utilizing accurate informations of synthetic images like object poses and lightning conditions which are helpful for recognizing regular photos. Firstly, our generative model with metric learning utilizes additional foreground object channels generated from semantic foreground object reconstruction sub-network for recognizing the original input images.  Multi-triplet cost function based on poses is used for metric learning which makes it possible training an effective categorical classifier purely based on synthetic data. Secondly, we design a coordinate training strategy with the help of adaptive noises applied on inputs of both of the concatenated sub-networks to make them benefit from each other and avoid inharmonious parameter tuning due to different convergence speed of two subnetworks. Our architecture achieves the state of the art accuracy of 50.5% on ShapeNet database with data migration obstacle from synthetic images to real photos. This pipeline makes it applicable to do recognition on real images only based on 3D models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
