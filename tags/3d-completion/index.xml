  Abstrarct Deep learning approaches process data in a layer-by-layer way with intermediate (or latent) features. We aim at designing a general solution to optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification, segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models. This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called nebula anchors, that guide the latent variables to form clusters during training.</description>

      <title>Learning Local Displacements for Point Cloud Completion</title>

Abstrarct We propose a novel approach aimed at object and semantic scene completion from a partial scan represented as a 3D point cloud. Our architecture relies on three novel layers that are used successively within an encoder-decoder structure and specifically developed for the task at hand. The first one carries out feature extraction by matching the point features to a set of pre-trained local descriptors. Then, to avoid losing individual descriptors as part of standard operations such as max-pooling, we propose an alternative neighbor-pooling operation that relies on adopting the feature vectors with the highest activations.</description>

  Abstrarct We propose a novel convolutional operator for the task of point cloud completion. One striking characteristic of our approach is that, conversely to related work it does not require any max-pooling or voxelization operation. Instead, the proposed operator used to learn the point cloud embedding in the encoder extracts permutation-invariant features from the point cloud via a soft-pooling of feature activations, which are able to preserve fine-grained geometric details.</description>

  Abstrarct Point clouds are often the default choice for many applications as they exhibit more flexibility and efficiency than volumetric data. Nevertheless, their unorganized nature &amp;ndash; points are stored in an unordered way &amp;ndash; makes them less suited to be processed by deep learning pipelines. In this paper, we propose a method for 3D object completion and classification based on point clouds. We introduce a new way of organizing the extracted features based on their activations, which we name soft pooling.</description>

  Abstrarct We propose a novel model for 3D semantic completion from a single depth image, based on a single encoder and three separate generators used to reconstruct different geometric and semantic representations of the original and completed scene, all sharing the same latent space. To transfer information between the geometric and semantic branches of the network, we introduce paths between them concatenating features at corresponding network layers.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Semantic Scene Completion from a Single Depth Image</title>

  Abstrarct We propose a method to reconstruct, complete and semantically label a 3D scene from a single input depth image. We improve the accuracy of the regressed semantic 3D maps by a novel architecture based on adversarial learning. In particular, we suggest using multiple adversarial loss terms that not only enforce realistic outputs with respect to the ground truth, but also an effective embedding of the internal features.</description>
