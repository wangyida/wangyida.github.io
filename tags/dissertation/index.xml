 Abstrarct Fed with a partial scan, single-view 3D completion models are expected to generate the completed geometry as an inference result. Applications such as AR/VR and autonomous driving could benefit from targets being presented in their complete structures, while occluded geometries are missing due to limited camera view. Learning-based 3D completion approach can reveal the occluded regions conditioned on a single view sample with the help of large-scale training data.</description>
